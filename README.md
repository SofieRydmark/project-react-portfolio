# React Portfolio
Updated version of my portfolio using React and styled components. 

## The problem
I structured the website in components and decided what could be reused as global styles and worked through each section of the site. 
Each section of the site has been styled using styled components and props. I created my own JSON files for maping my projects under featured and other projects. 
I created a custom domain this time for my site.
