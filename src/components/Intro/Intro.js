          Hello! I`m a student at Technigo and will be a graduated frontend
          developer in january 2023. I have worked for nearly 10 years in media
          and recently as a programmatic trader. I love that you can be so
          creative with code and I have a good eye for design and the use of CSS.
          I am a very fast learner that thrive in a team who help each other and have fun.

    </SectionContainer>
